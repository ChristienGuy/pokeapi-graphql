This is graphql wrapper for [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co). It was made mostly as a learning excercise so it's likely to be poorly written.

It currently support a core set of endpoints but only a handful of items within each.

These are being added to regularly but if there is anything that is high priority for you, open an issue/make a PR and we can get it set up quicker.

* Pokedex (list of available pokemon)
* Pokemon
* Pokemon Form
* Abilities
* Moves
